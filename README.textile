*Work In Progress*

Tools to convert Redis' RDB file to other formats such as JSON, or to other database formats such as a SQL script. 

Right now, we have documented the structure of the RDB file. The script rdb2json.py is able to parse about 80% of the RDB; it cannot parse LZF encoded strings at the moment.

create_test_rdb.py inserts data in a local redis database. The intention is to create a small rdb file that has exercises all paths in our code.
